Support
=======

Please check out the [documentation](/documentation), in particular
the [FAQ](/faq/). If you are stuck, below are some ways you can get
help and support to install and set up FireHOL.

Issue tracker
-------------

If you think you've found a bug, the [FireHOL issue
tracker](https://github.com/firehol/firehol/issues) is the best place to
report it.

The issue tracker is also an acceptable forum for more general questions.

Mailing List
------------

We have a
[support mailing
list](http://lists.firehol.org/mailman/listinfo/firehol-support). New
release and security announcements will be made to this list and you can
get help from the authors and other experienced users of FireHOL.

You can read the [archive](//lists.firehol.org/pipermail/firehol-support/) and
[search](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:lists.firehol.org) the list
contents to see if your question has been answered before.
