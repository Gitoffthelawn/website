FireHOL is an amazing tool. It leverages the incredible power of
netfilter/iptables to turn Linux into a viable firewall solution, even
for complex scenarios where people would think "Cisco PIX" or "Check
Point FW-1".

Right now I'm using it on a box that filters the traffic passing between
the public Internet, 4 VLANs, 1 DMZ and 2 VPN endpoints, with address
forwardings (DNAT) thrown in for good measure. This amounts to over 3000
iptables rules (according to "iptables-save") and I still haven't lost
my sanity!

Needless to say, I'm using it on all the other Linux servers too. :)
