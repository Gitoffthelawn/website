Hello, I just wanted to thank you for making FireHOL. Explaining
firewalls to my girlfriend is, well, a tough thing to do. After getting
your script configured and our new DSL connection working, she said "Wow
that was fast", then the inevitable "What did you do?". I showed her the
short script and she read it like it was english. I can't stop smiling.
