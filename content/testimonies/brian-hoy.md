I want to thank you for making such a brilliant firewall configuration
tool. I have just finished configuring a firewall with 5 ethernets (two
office LANs, two DMZs and one ISP upstream with aliased IPs) for two
companies with a shared broadband internet connection, and it works
perfectly.

I still marvel at the shortness and simplicity of your configuration
language contrasted against the completeness and tightness of the fully
stateful iptables rules!
