Just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know that I just
installed FireHOL 1.120 on my Linux router/firewall, and it worked like
a champ!

Super-easy (your example on the FireHOL web page is a perfect starting
point for setups like mine, which is a single PC doing NAT/MASQ and
firewalling over DSL for an internal LAN) and much more effective than
my old stateless firewall that it replaced (which wouldn't even let me
ftp without shutting it down).

Just wanted to say thanks for a job well done, and for making your work
available to the rest of us!
